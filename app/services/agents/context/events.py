"""
Pipeline event types and emitter for observable conversation runtime.

These events mark the stages of context building and agent execution.
Events can be emitted to a request-scoped async queue for SSE streaming.

Context variable approach:
  - Request handler sets event queue in context
  - Pipeline stages emit events to the queue
  - SSE generator yields events from the queue
  - Clean separation of concerns with contextvars

For development/testing without streaming:
  - Events are logged to console if queue is not set
